# ArrayList of Rectangle Objects

A program that keeps track of a list of rectangles.

### Steps

1. define class `Rectangle` - one object represents objects `length` & `width`
1. define objects in `Rectangle` and store them in an `ArrayList` 
1. create a second class `TestRectangle`
1. in `TestRectangle` prompt user for `length` & `width` then store user values
1. in main() `TestRectangle` define a new `ArrayList` of rectangle objects
1. add the rectangle object you created in the new `ArrayList` & print
1. write loop that repeats this process four times
1. at this point you have four `Rectangle` objects inside your `ArrayList` & print to verify

#### Hints

* write down expected output before writing program
* declare final int for the number of `Rectangle` objects so that it is easily changed
